### WADAC

WADAC is a privacy-preserving anomaly detection and attack classification framework developed by ReSILIoT. This repository comprises of the source code and sample datasets for work done in the paper  WADAC: Privacy-Preserving Anomaly Detection and Attack Classification on Wireless Traffic 


### Prerequisites

- The Feature Extractor module of WADAC is developed in python 2.7.0
- Feature Selection, Anomaly Detector and Attack Classification are developed in R (3.4.2)
  

### Test Run

- Unzip the following files:
  - base_attack_traffic.db.zip
  - ids_disclosure_wisec_trace.zip
  - WADAC_Database.zip
- For feature extraction, run extract_features.py from feature_extraction folder.
- For feature selection, anomaly detection and attack classification, run main.R in Anomaly_detector folder
